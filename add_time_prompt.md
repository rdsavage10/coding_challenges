### Assignment
​
Write a function named `add_time` that takes in two parameters:
* a start time in the 12-hour clock format (ending in AM or PM)
* a duration time that indicates the number of hours and minutes
​
The function should add the duration time to the start time and return the result.
​
Here are some examples that demonstrate the different cases the function should handle:
Here are some examples of different casses the function should handle:
```py
add_time("3:00 PM", "3:10")
# Returns: 6:10 PM
​
add_time("11:30 AM", "2:32")
# Returns: 2:02 PM
​
add_time("1:45 AM", "0:15")
# Returns: 2:00 AM
​
add_time("10:10 PM", "3:30")
# Returns: 1:40 AM
​
add_time("9:43 PM", "24:00")
# Returns: 9:43 PM
​
add_time("6:30 PM", "205:12")
# Returns: 7:42 AM
```
​
Do not import any Python libraries. Assume the start times are valid times. The minutes in the duration time will be 60 or less, but the hour can be any whole number.
​
The unit tests for this project are in `test_module.py`.
​
### Development
​
Write your code in `time_calculator.py`. For development, you can use `main.py` to test your `time_calculator()` function. Click the "run" button and `main.py` will run.
​
### Testing
​
We imported the tests from `test_module.py` to `main.py` for your convenience. The tests will run automatically whenever you hit the "run" button.
